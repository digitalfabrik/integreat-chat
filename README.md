# About

RAG/LLM supported online migration counseling service & improved Integreat search engine. It integrates as a chat service into the [Integreat App](https://github.com/digitalfabrik/integreat-app) and presents requests in a Zammad to counselors. The solution aims to be privacy friendly by not using any third party LLM services.

This project is currently in a research and development phase. The code created for this repo aims to be compatible for future integration into the [Integreat CMS](https://github.com/digitalfabrik/integreat-cms). For the time being the code is separated for faster iteration and testing.

Major issues that have to be addressed:

- Support for low ressource languages
- Code mixing
- Language detection
- Translations
