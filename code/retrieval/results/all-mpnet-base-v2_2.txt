German courses run by the city of Munich If you want to live in Germany, it’s very important to learn the German Language.

You don’t have access to an integration course? You would like to improve your German skills? You can’t afford to pay for a German language class?

Then use the course programmes run by the city of Munich! The programme ranges from literacy classes to C2 level. There are special courses for adolescents and with occupational content. For everyone – right from the beginning! More information is available in the »» integration advice centre IBZ-Sprache und Beruf
