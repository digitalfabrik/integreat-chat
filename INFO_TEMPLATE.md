# The Integreat Chat

Our chatbot helps you to find Integreat content and answer questions about the content. It is currently only available on the website https://integreat.app. It is not available in the apps installed via the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.

## How the chatbot works

The Integreat chat can be opened on the website by clicking on the chat icon at the bottom. When you ask a question, you will receive an answer from our chatbot. However, if you need more personalised support, an employee will answer your question as quickly as possible. Please note that this may take some time. If you ask for a personalised conversation, the chatbot will stop answering.

Our chatbot can only answer questions that are covered by the content of the currently selected region. If you have a question that is not related to our content, we will not be able to answer it.

If you need information from another region, please select that region first and then ask your question. The chatbot is not available in all regions.feedback

## Language support

You can ask questions in many languages. Our chatbot will answer your questions in the language you have selected. If you would like answers in another language, select your preferred language in the menu.a

## Feedback

We are constantly working on improving our chatbot and our platform. We use anonymised questions asked in the chat to improve Integreat content and the chatbot. You can leave us feedback in the chat at any time. We will take your suggestions into account in the best possible way.

## Deletion of the data

Chats that are no longer active will be completely deleted after 1 year at the latest.
