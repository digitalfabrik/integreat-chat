# The Integreat Chat

Our chatbot helps you find Integreat content and answer questions based on the content. It is currently only available on the website https://integreat.app. It is not available in the apps installed via the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.

## How the Chatbot works

The Integreat chat can be opened on the website by clicking on the chat icon at the bottom. If you ask a question, you'll receive a response from our chatbot. However, if you need more personalized assistance, a representative will answer your question as quickly as possible. Please note that this may take some time. If you ask to talk to a person, the chat bot will stop answering.

Our chatbot can only answer questions covered by the content of the currently selected region. If you have a question that's not related to our content, we can't answer it.

If you need information from a different region, please select that region first and then ask your question. The chatbot is not available in all regions.

## Language support

You can ask questions in many languages. Our chatbot will answer your questions in the language you choose. If you want to receive responses in a different language, choose your preferred language in the menu.

## Feedback

We're constantly working to improve our chatbot and our platform. We will use anonymized chat messages to improve automatic chat responses in the future. You can leave us feedback in the chat at any time. We'll consider your suggestions as best we can.
