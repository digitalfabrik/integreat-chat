Doula Cloud München – Birth support and counselling for refugee women from all over the world
The word “doula” (from the Greek) means “to serve” or “to care for”. A GfG-Doula® is a woman who has given birth to children of her own and has well-founded knowledge about childbirth. A doula does not take on a medical function, but understands a woman’s emotional needs during childbirth and can provide empathetic, continuous and individual support. This means that she breathes with her, helps her to relax through massage, comforts her, encourages her, looks after her, depending on what the mother needs at the time. Even after the birth, the doula remains a contact person for the young family.
This companionship lessens fears  and builds more trust and confidence in the birth.  The expectant father or partner also benefit from the support of a doula, as they are not solely responsible for supporting the woman in labour in a situation that is completely unknown and perhaps frightening for them.
Doulas are known and appreciated in all Munich maternity wards. And birth doesn’t need much talking.
Who’s it for: pregnant women and women with babies from all over the world who have residence and asylum.
The service is free.
 Female interpreters are available.
All premises have barrier-free access as well as a disabled toilet.
