Accident at work
If you have an accident during work or on your way to work, this is defined as an accident at work.
In this case, you are insured via the company (your employee) through accident insurance.
If you go to the doctor or hospital you must tell them that it’s an accident at work. The treatment will not be paid by your health insurance company but by the accident insurance of the employer. You can find out the name of the accident insurance from your employer.
If you have an accident at work and

are unfit for work for more than one day or
require medical treatment for longer or
get sick again at a later date

you need to go to a so-called “Durchgangsarzt or Durchgangsärtzin” (“accident insurance doctor”).
You can find these doctors on the website of the  German state accident insurance company.
