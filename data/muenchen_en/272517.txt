Gynaecological consultation for women and girls with impaired mobility
The consultation is a normal gynaecological consultation and is offered by gynaecologists in the city of Munich. It offers preventive examinations, diagnostics and therapy for gynaecological complaints and diseases, support during pregnancy and counselling on issues of sexuality, the desire for children and contraception, as well as support during menopause.
Should your enquiry relate to severe medical concerns and interventions, the doctor will refer you to an appropriate outpatient or inpatient facility. The doctor will, of course, decide this together with you.
The gynaecologists are supported by an experienced nurse and a medical assistant. You do not have to bring your own companion or confidant, but you may, of course, do so if you wish.
Who’s it for: The consultation is for women living in Munich who experience impaired mobility – for example, wheelchair users. You may
register for the consultation even if you have multiple disabilities.
 Interpreters are available on request.
All premises have barrier-free access as well as a disabled toilet.
