IHK - Integration counselling
Consultation hours:
Information about occupations in a dual apprenticeship
The consultation hour is a free service of the IHK Integration Team
and is aimed at migrants and refugees in the whole of Upper Bavaria.
Our team advises in one-on-one discussions on all questions relating to the topic of
starting your training in Germany. Before the apprenticeship, we
will look together to see which job suits you, where you can apply and what
your application documents will look like.

Skills evaluation check.work (before apprenticeship):
The online tool check.work helps refugees (with B1 language
skills) to identify skills relevant to the apprenticeship. It also
provides orientation in terms of which apprenticeship professions are on offer and where an internship
would make sense. Individuals can apply for the test through the Agentur für Arbeit (Employment Agency).
