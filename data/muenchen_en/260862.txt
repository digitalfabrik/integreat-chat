Contracts
Contracts in Germany 
In Germany, we have what is known as freedom of contract. If you want to use a smartphone, rent a flat, or join a gym, for example, you will have to enter into a contract (either verbal or written). Always pay close attention to what the contract says: How is the total price calculated? Are there additional monthly fees besides a one-off payment?
Contracts are binding and have to be followed. You can only terminate a contract within the notice period stated. If you are not sure if you can pay the ongoing costs or whether you have understood everything correctly, do not sign the contract, otherwise you could commit a criminal offence.
Never sign a document if you do not understand it or cannot read it.
It is possible that you might enter a contract or legal agreement by signing a document. This could result in financial costs for you. As soon as a contract has been signed, it is very difficult to withdraw from it. Always compare different offers and do not let anyone pressure you to sign.
