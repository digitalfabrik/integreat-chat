Naturalisation
If you have been living in Germany regularly for at least eight years, you can make an application for naturalisation (getting German citizenship). Marital partners and children can receive German citizenship at the same time, even if they have been living in Germany for a shorter length of time. Adolescents from the age of 16 can make their own application for naturalisation.
For certain groups of people (such as people entitled to asylum, marital partners of German citizens) there are different prerequisites (such as shorter minimum periods of stay).
You can find more information on the different requirements for getting German citizenship  here.
The Einbürgerungsbüro (Naturalisation office) of the federal capital city of München offers advice about the topic of naturalisation. You can make an appointment here.
