Apply for a birth certificate for a newborn baby
You need to register the birth and the name of your child in the Geburtenbüro (births office) at the Standesamt (registry office). As soon as the birth is registered, the Geburtenbüro can issue you with a birth certificate.
In Munich there are two registry offices. The Standesamt you need to go to depends on the district your child was born in. The hospitals usually give the parents an information leaflet with the address of the Standesamt you should go to.
