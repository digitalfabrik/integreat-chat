House regulations
House regulations list specific rules about living together with others. They apply to all people living in group accommodation or an apartment. The most important ones are:
Noise: Everyone living in the building is responsible for keeping noise levels as low as possible. You must take special care from 12:00 to 15:00 and from 22:00 to 07:00: These are known as the quiet times.
Ventilation: You should open the windows frequently to let in fresh air. This prevents mould from developing.
