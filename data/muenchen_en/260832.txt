Rule of law
Germany is a democratic state. The Grundgesetz (basic law) guarantees human dignity, freedom and justice. There are laws to ensure that human rights are upheld.
Political decisions are made by representatives of the people. In Germany, these political representatives are elected in free elections.
The laws apply in the same way to everybody in Germany. The state has to abide by the law. Everyone living in Germany must also abide by German laws.
This means, for example:

If someone believes that another person or the public administration has committed an injustice against them, they can take that person or institution to court. The courts are independent. This means: The government is not allowed to tell the courts what to decide.
State courts decide whether or not someone will be punished for their actions. This punishment could take the form of a fine, community service or prison. There is no death penalty in Germany.
The police has the role of ensuring that everyone is able to live in freedom and safety.
Religion must not violate laws. Laws always take priority over religion.

The following behaviour is not allowed in Germany:

Inciting people to hatred or to do violent actions.
Fighting against the democratic system and its values.

These offences can lead to you being put in prison.
After serving their sentence, non-German nationals can lose their right to remain in Germany (under certain circumstances) and be deported.
