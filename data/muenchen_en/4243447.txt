
Compulsory education and School district

Compulsory education
In Germany, attending school is compulsory: Children aged between 6 and 15 must go to school. In Bavaria, you are then obliged to attend vocational college until the age of 21, if school attendance is not continued at a general school. This obligation to attend vocational college does not apply if you complete your school education by obtaining Abitur (higher education entrance certificate) or Fachabitur (vocational higher education entrance certificate). Parents have to ensure that their children regularly attend school. Attending state and municipal schools is free.
If a child is sick, the parents have to ring up in the morning before 08:00.
School district
If the child attends a public Grundschule (primary) or Mittelschule (basic secondary school), it has to go to the school that is responsible for the child’s location - to a Sprengelschule. “Sprengel” means “school district”.
