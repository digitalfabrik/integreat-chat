
Housing benefit
The state also helps citizens with low incomes who do not receive benefits from the Job Centre. For example, tenants and subtenants of a flat or home residents can get a rent subsidy. People who own a house, a flat or a part-time farm can also apply for housing benefit. 
Requirements
Entitlement to housing benefit and the amount depend on three factors:

on the number of household members
the amount of the total income
the amount of the rent or the monthly burden.

In addition to the person receiving housing benefit, other household members can also be taken into account, for example spouses, civil partners, children, parents or siblings.
Those who already receive support for housing costs through unemployment benefit II, basic income support in old age or reduced earning capacity cannot receive housing benefit in addition. 
Persons who receive benefits under the Asylum Seekers' Benefits Act cannot apply for housing benefit.
Application and proof
To receive housing benefit, you must submit an application and various supporting documents:

the annual income of all household members as well as the pension
the rent or costs. Costs include certain expenses for repayment and interest as well as maintenance or administration costs.
