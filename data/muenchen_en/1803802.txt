Personal liability insurance
Even if you unintentionally cause harm to a person in Germany, you must pay damages according to the law. This applies to personal injury, material damage and property damage in the private sector. For example, if you cause a traffic accident or if your child breaks a window with a ball.
In Germany, you can take out personal liability insurance that will pay for this damage for you and your family/children. It is not compulsory to have this insurance but it is very much recommended because otherwise you could face very high costs if you or your family cause damage. Your help centre can assist you in finding a good offer for personal liability insurance via the »» Immigration counselling centres.
