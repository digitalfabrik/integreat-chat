Verwaltungsgericht (VG) München
The Verwaltungsgericht München (Munich district court) supports the Bavarian administrative courts. It is responsible for the region of Upper Bavaria.
If an application for asylum is rejected by the Bundesamt für Migration und Flüchtlinge – BAMF, you can usually appeal against this at the Verwaltungsgericht München. The court checks the decision of the Bundesamt für Migration und Flüchtlinge (BAMF). If the court comes to a different decision, it can compel the BAMF to offer the plaintiff (you) protection. If it confirms the decision, then the appeal is rejected.
In order to appeal, we recommend that you get advice and representation from a specialist lawyer for asylum and residence law.
