Münchner Kammerspiele
The Münchner Kammerspiele are the city’s theatre.
We enable social exchange, open up perspectives and tell stories that have never been heard before. And we ask about new responsibilities in the theatre: Who talks, who decides, what and how is the story told?
We see theatre as a laboratory – and as a resource for future forms of coexistence; as a place where new social knowledge is generated. In doing so, we are looking for new terms, exotic and beautiful languages, viable corporeality and the connecting narratives of the future.
We look forward to seeing you!
Who’s it for: For every man/woman & art enthusiasts
