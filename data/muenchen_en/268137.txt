The Amt für Ausbildungsförderung promotes and supports education and further training. It grants funding according to the laws: Bundesausbildungsförderungsgesetz (BAföG) and Aufstiegsfortbildungsförderungsgesetz (AFBG) and advises you on the application procedure.
You are normally only allowed to receive BAföG if you are not yet 30 years old when beginning the relevant section of your training. The funding is also dependent on your residence status and the income of your parents or marital partner. Funding according to the AFBG is independent of your age and the income of your family. A certain residence status is necessary and only certain types of advanced training are funded.
