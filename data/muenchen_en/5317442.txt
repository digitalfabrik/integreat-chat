
Counselling centre for women* who experience or have experienced intimate partner violence.
Violence in a partnership takes many forms and often does not begin with beatings.
Your partner or ex-partner...- insults, offends or humiliates you?- makes you look bad to others?- controls you and your contact with friends and family?- threatens you and your family?- threatens to take your children away from you?- pushes or hits you?- puts sexual pressure on you?
You ask yourself...- how can I protect myself and my children?- what will happen to me if I separate?- what will happen next in my life?
The offer is free of charge.
 Interpreters are available by arrangement. We can also organise a sign language translator. We pay the costs.
Children can be brought along.
There is barrier-free access to the building and premises.
Make an appointment or come to our open office hours: Tuesday 4 - 6 p.m. and Thursday 10 - 12 p.m.
