Bellevue running group
Running long distances is good for your body, heart and soul. We run every week together along the Isar River and get fit for the marathon, half-marathon and shorter runs. Everyone is invited to get fit and strong in our group and get to know a diverse group of people. The running group is led by Paul Huf who has many years of running experience and is an enthusiastic runner and triathlete.
