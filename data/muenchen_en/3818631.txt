Special rules about the topic of staying abroad (expiry of the residence permit) – ending of the legal residence
These rules can also apply to people with an Aufenthaltserlaubnis (residence permit) / a Niederlassungserlaubnis (settlement permit)!
If you want to remain abroad for a longer time, you need a certificate from the Ausländerbehörde (Immigration Office). The certificate is necessary because otherwise your resident permit can be cancelled.
Please come to the Ausländerbehörde (Immigration Office) in good time before the start of a longer stay abroad, because we cannot issue a certificate after you have already left.
You can find more information here in  German and  English
