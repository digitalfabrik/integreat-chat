Salary statement
If you are an employee, you will receive a salary statement or payslip after you have worked your first month. Some employers then also issue you with a monthly statement; others only do this when there is a change (such as Christmas money, higher insurance contributions ...).
These details must be shown in the salary statement or payslip:

Name and address of the employee
Name, address, date of birth of the employer
Insurance number of the employee
Date of beginning the employment
Tax category and tax identification number
Accounting period
Gross wages (salary without deductions – gross tax amount, gross social insurance amount)
Type and amount of surcharges or bonuses
Type and amount of deductions
Net amount (after all deductions)

The net amount is usually the amount you receive. Exception: If there were advance payments, or loans from the company or salary seizure (if you have debts), further amounts will be removed from the net amount.
