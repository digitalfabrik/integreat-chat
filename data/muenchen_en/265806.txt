Interpreters
If you don’t yet speak good German and have to go to authorities such as the Ausländerbehörde (Immigration Office), Sozialamt (Social Welfare Office) or Schulamt (School Authorities), you will need an interpreter. And an interpreter can also be very helpful for visits to the doctor or during parents’ evenings at schools and nurseries.
Some authorities and institutions have language mediators themselves and you can use them during appointments. When you make an appointment, please always ask if an interpreter is provided free of charge.
TranslAid
