My stay in Germany – what is the legal situation?
A person at your final place of residence will supervise you and help you in all legal issues. This person is your legal guardian.
What does a legal guardian do?
If a refugee who is younger than 18 year of age comes to Germany on their own, they require an adult to legally represent them in place of their parents. This person is known as a legal guardian.
The legal guardian has various tasks. He or she:

Regularly keeps in contact with you
Represents your interests towards the Jugendamt (Youth Welfare Office), the Ausländerbehörde (Immigration Office) and other institutions
Accompanies you during your asylum procedure
Applies for any help you may need
Supports you in clarifying other matters such as health issues

What will my new place of residence look like?

At your new location you will live with other young people in one house. Adults are available to support you 24 hours a day.
You will start school immediately. It’s important that you learn German so that you make contact with new people quickly.
What does Schulpflicht (compulsory education) mean?
In Germany, schooling is mandatory up until the age of 18. This means that you go to school until you have a school qualification or start a training course/apprenticeship.
What educational possibilities do I have in Germany?
The type of school you will go to depends on how old you are and how long you have already attended school. After you get your school qualification, your supervisors will support you in finding a suitable workplace or an apprenticeship as long as this is legally permitted
