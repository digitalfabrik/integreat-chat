Counselling on residence rights for people with insecure status
We, the team at Café 104, accompany you when you go to the authorities, make applications for a Duldung (temporary postponement of deportation) or residence for humanitarian reasons on your behalf and organise psychiatric evaluations if this is necessary for an application. We give pregnant women medical assistance and advise you on your residence status until the birth of your child and, if necessary, beyond this date.
Who’s it for: People without residence permits
Barrier-free access to the building and premises is available.
The service is free.
