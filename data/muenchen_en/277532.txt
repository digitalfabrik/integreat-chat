Self-assertion and self-defence for girls and women from 4 years, adolescent girls and women
“Wildwasser München” is an advice centre to support women in cases of sexual violence and to protect women and girls from sexual violence.
We offer self-assertion and self-defence courses also in refugee hostels, residential institutions, youth centres, youth centres, schools, nurseries and many other places.

 Women and girls learn to set boundaries: “Leave me alone!”,
“Go away!”, “Don’t touch me!”
 Women and girls learn to defend themselves – with words but also by hitting, kicking and more.
 Women and girls learn how and where they can get help.
 Women and girls learn what their rights are.
