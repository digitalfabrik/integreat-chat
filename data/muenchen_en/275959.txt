Eltern Aktiv – training for parents in their native tongue
Training for parents in their native tongue strengthens the parenting skills for mothers and fathers with a migration background and / or who had to flee their home country. The programme is aimed at parents of children between the ages of 0 and 13. The training programme contains 12 units of 2 hours each and is divided into different blocks that build upon each other. Through their cultural vicinity and shared mother tongue, the parenting trainers can reflect the values on parenting and family on a basis of trust and understanding. During the training, the parents maintain and use the values and skills that they already possess and extend them with new knowledge about issues relevant to parenting in Germany. The programme is free and can be offered in 20 languages.
You can bring your children with you. Childcare is available on request.
