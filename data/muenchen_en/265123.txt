Personal hearing
This is the most important appointment in the asylum procedure. You will receive an invitation to attend. There will be an interpreter available.
You must attend this appointment in all circumstances. If you are unable to attend, you must tell the authority in good time and explain why you are not able to come. Otherwise your asylum application may be rejected or the procedure stopped.
In the personal hearing you can explain why you had to flee your country. You will be asked about your life, your situation, your travel route to Germany and the reasons why you are persecuted in your country of origin. If possible you should present evidence for your statements in the personal hearing.
The hearing will be carried out by specialist employees.
You can be accompanied to the appointment by:

a lawyer or solicitor
a representative of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR)
another person you trust who is not involved in an asylum procedure themselves

For unaccompanied minors, the guardian can attend the hearing.
Your statements will be translated and recorded. Then they will be re-translated to you. You will, therefore, have the opportunity to add information or make corrections. Finally, the minutes of the hearing will be presented to you with the statements. If everything has been correctly presented, you confirm this with your signature.
Advice services from the Bundesamt für Migration und Flüchtlinge (BAMF) to prepare you for your personal hearing in the asylum procedure will soon be available.
