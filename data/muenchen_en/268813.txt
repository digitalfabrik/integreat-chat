Recognition of school qualifications
General school qualifications from abroad can be examined and recognised as equivalent in some cases. This depends on the school you attended, the country, the duration of the school visit and the school subjects taught.
The Bayerisches Landesamt für Schule is responsible for the recognition of school qualifications gained abroad.
 Here you can find details on the opening times for telephone and personal consultations, contact details and other helpful information.
