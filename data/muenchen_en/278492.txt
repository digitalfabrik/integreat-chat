Poetry and rap workshop in Bellevue di Monaco
In regular workshops, the participants learn different writing techniques and lyrical styles to work on their own poetry and rap texts together, and then perform them.
The workshop is suitable both for newcomers and also advanced rappers, German mother tongue natives and people who are just learning German. Everyone writes in the language that he or she feels closest to – in teams (live) translations can be developed or multi-language performances can be created.
We warmly invite you: Bring your friends, stories, experiences and ideas with you and write poetry!
Who’s it for: Refugees, residents of Munich
