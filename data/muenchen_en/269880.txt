Training agency for crafts: Career guidance, support with looking for internships and apprenticeships
The Handwerkskammer München employs training agents (Ausbildungsakquisiteure) who want to pass on their enthusiasm for a career as a crafts person to young people.
What does a training agent do?

A training agent communicates the diverse career chances that are possible in over 130 vocational careers in skilled crafts and trades.
The agents discover what career potential the young people have and help them to realise this.
They support them in the search for an internship or apprenticeship place.
They find companies who are prepared to train young people with a migration background.
They support the training companies and the adolescents, if problems occur.
They take part in career information days and present crafts and trade vocational training courses at schools and careers fairs.

Who’s it for: young people with a migration background aged 12 to 27 years
 Interpreters available for Turkish if required.
Barrier-free access to buildings and premises and a disabled toilet are available.
The service is free.
