LGBTIQ*-QueerBeats Choir
QueerBeats is a choir for all LGBTIQ* persons between the ages of 14 and 27 who enjoy making music together. If you feel uncertain before taking part for the first time or have any questions about the group, you are welcome to contact our social education workers at any time. As our meetings are intended to create a safe space and to preserve your anonymity, no photos or video recordings are made.
For some activities there  is a small charge to cover costs.
