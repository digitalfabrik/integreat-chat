We provide counselling to people who have experienced right-wing, racist and anti-human violence and discrimination. The reasons can be manifold: Origin, gender, religion, disability, age, social status, sexual identity or anti-racist commitment. 
Counselling is free of charge, anonymous and independent of state authorities. 
The people who have experienced something like this are our focus. We support them in exercising their rights, coping with the consequences of an attack and dealing with unequal treatment.
