Protecting children and adolescents
Caring for and parenting children is the natural right of the parents.
However, children, adolescents and families are specially protected in Germany. This protection starts during pregnancy and continues until the child has reached 18 years of age (adult). In Germany, for example, it is forbidden to hit children or adolescents: Children must be raised in Germany without the use of violence. All children must attend school.
Public authorities make sure that children are not harmed by their environment – or by their family. These public authorities also support and help families that need help.
The Sozialbürgerhäuser are responsible for this task in Munich. You can ask for support there. The Sozialbürgerhaus responsible for you depends on your address.
