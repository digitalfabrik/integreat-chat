Kindertreff OLY in the Olympic village
The Kindertreff OLY has been established as a drop-in leisure facility for children in the Olympic village for many years. All children are welcome, independent of their social origin, religion, gender or nationality. Registration is not required, the children can come and go when they want.
In the OLY you can meet up with friends, play table football, jump around in the cushion room, play billiards or Wii, listen to music, do crafts, read and much more. On a Friday afternoon, we cook or bake together.
Trips are organised in the school holidays (there is sometimes a charge for these).
Whoâ€™s it for: Children aged between 6 and 13 years
Barrier-free access to the building and premises is available.
The service is free.
