FrienTS – leisure group for young trans* people
The FrienTS is a leisure group for young trans* people between the ages of 14 and 27 years, who would like to do things together and want to get to know new people. If you feel uncertain before taking part for the first time or have any questions about the group, you are welcome to contact our social education workers at any time. As our meetings are intended to create a safe space and to preserve your anonymity, no photos or video recordings are made.
