Outpatient psychotherapy for traumatised refugees and victims of torture
We offer different forms of therapy (individual, group and art therapy) for people who are suffering from post-traumatic stress owing to their experiences in their country of origin or whilst fleeing. The therapy offered is voluntary and takes place in the premises of Refugio München or selected cooperation partners (outpatient basis). Wherever possible, we work in the respective mother tongue and employ specially trained interpreters. In addition to our therapy services we offer our clients social-pedagogic counselling.
Health insurance is not required!
