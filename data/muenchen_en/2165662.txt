Female genital mutilation
The sewing up, circumcision or mutilation of female genitalia is a grave violation of human rights. Affected girls and women suffer from the physical and psychological consequences for the rest of their lives. Female genital mutilation is a punishable offence in Germany. It is also punishable if female genital mutilation is performed abroad. Anyone who helps another person at home or abroad to perform female genital mutilation or circumcision is also liable to prosecution.
