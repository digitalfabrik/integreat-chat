Gender equality
Women and men have the same rights. This is reflected in the law and in daily life.
This means, for example:

Girls and boys go to school together and receive the same lessons. They take part in sports education together.
Both women and men are allowed to study or learn a profession. All professions are fundamentally open to both genders.
Women play important roles in society, for example as police officers, doctors, teachers or in government offices and agencies. Their instructions must be followed.
Women decide themselves which career they want to have. They can spend their money as they wish.
Women do not need to ask their husband, parents or other family members for permission to work, open a bank account, or sign contracts.
Women are allowed to dress as they like
Women decide for themselves who, when and if they marry.
Mothers are given extra help and support. They do not have to (and are not permitted to) work for six weeks before the birth or eight weeks after the birth. They cannot be fired from their jobs because they become mothers.
The tasks and roles in the family are not fixed.
Women participate in public life. They attend cultural, political or sports events, restaurants and bars.
Women can vote and be elected to political office.
Women and men have equal inheritance rights, daughters as much as sons.
 Sexual contact, comments or solicitations are only allowed if everyone involved consents. A "stop" or "no" must always be respected.

The following behaviour is not allowed in Germany:

Any form of violence against women, including within marriage.
No one is allowed to sexually harass another person.
Rape – including within marriage – is punishable.
No one can be forced to marry. The coercion of a marriage by force or threat will be prosecuted.
