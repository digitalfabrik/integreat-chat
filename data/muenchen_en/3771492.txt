Housing advisory service
For refugees in particular, it’s often very difficult to find an affordable apartment in Bavaria, especially in Munich. We help you to prepare for your apartment search in a targeted manner.
The advisers of the Munich Refugees Council go through your documents together with you, explain how to present yourself in the best light based on your personal documents and give you tips on finding apartments.- We support you in putting together an effective application portfolio when looking for an apartment.- We advise you on which documents you require.- We help you compile the necessary documents.- We show you how looking for apartments on the “open apartment market” works.- We offer tips on preparing for apartment viewings.
We are notable to rent apartments to you ourselves!
