LOK Arrival – leisure area for refugee and homeless children and adolescents in the grounds of the Bayernkaserne
We offer refugee and homeless children and young people between the ages of 3 and 26 a wide range of leisure activities on the grounds of the former Bayernkaserne. The aim of our work is to offer young people a venue where they can actively shape their leisure time. In the open meeting place, visitors can use a Soccer5 facility, a billiards room, table tennis tables, table football, a reading corner, indoor games, media offers and a variety of outdoor play equipment.
There are also services for groups, such as TaeBo fitness, bouldering, creative workshops or football training. Targeted activities for girls and boys are also held each week. In addition to the open day, we offer a variety of excursions, festivals and cultural activities.
Participation, project work and gender-specific workshops are emphasised in particular. Our educational work focuses on empowering young people and creating spaces for encounters.
