Help if you are in danger of losing your home
If you are in danger of losing your home through termination or eviction, you can contact the Fachstelle zur Vermeidung von Wohnungslosigkeit (office for avoidance of homelessness). You can find one in every of the twelve Munich Sozialbürgerhäuser. The office advises and supports you, gets involved and refers you for further help. It is important to contact to the office as soon as possible so that you can keep various deadlines and avoid additional costs.
The Fachstelle zur Vermeidung von Wohnungslosigkeit advises you on the following topics:

Taking over rent arrears
Legality of the eviction
Possible economic help
Entitlement to housing allowance or other housing payments
Personal help (advice for people in debt, social-pedagogic help)

 You need to bring these documents with you.
To have a consultation with the office, you need to arrange an appointment with the clerk in the  Sozialbürgerhaus responsible for you.
