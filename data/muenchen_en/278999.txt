KunstWerkRaum – an intercultural project in the Pinakothek der Moderne
Our intercultural workshop for people of different ages always takes place on Fridays at 15:00. The four Pinakothek der Modern museums, focussing on art, design, architecture and graphic art, offer us many points of reference for discussions, joint discoveries and artistic experiments. The main focus of the KunstWerkRaum is on enjoying art, experiencing things together and intercultural exchange. We speak simple, easy to understand German, and some English if required.
The event is organised by the Museumspädagogischen Zentrum / MPZ (museum educational centre).
