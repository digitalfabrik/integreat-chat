IBZ Beruf for the long-term unemployed
The IBZ Beruf is a sub-project of the urban joint project Perspektive Arbeit (VPA). We want to help socially disadvantaged, long-term unemployed people to stabilise their personal life situation, to further their education and to take up a job that secures a livelihood for them. Established training providers in the Munich labour market offer a closely linked counselling and qualification network for this purpose. This enables us to provide comprehensive support for individuals who are difficult to place and those returning to work.
Who’s it for: Long-term unemployed individuals in Munich (whether receiving ALG II benefit or not) with a work permit in Germany, language level A2 / B1, aged 18 and over.
The service is free.
You can bring your children with you.
