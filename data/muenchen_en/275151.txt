enBees – leisure group for young non-binary people
The enBees is a leisure group for all non-binary people between the ages of 14 and 27 years, who would like to do things together and want to get to know new people. If you feel uncertain before taking part for the first time or have any questions about the group, you are welcome to contact our social education workers at any time. As our meetings are intended to create a safe space and to preserve your anonymity, no photos or video recordings are made.
Who’s it for: non-binary people between 14 and 27 years
The term “non-binary” describes people whose gender identity is neither male nor female or does not only correspond to the two labels male and female.
For some activities there is a small charge to cover costs.
