FamilienZentrum Laim
We are an organisation for families in the district that focuses its work on the needs of children and their mothers and fathers:

We promote contact and get-togethers,
provide stimulus and enrichment,
provide alleviation in the everyday life of families.

Our aim is to create good conditions for children to grow up healthily and free of violence. Our Help to Help Yourself programme creates a place for your own creativity and for you to get involved. Families can build up healthy relationships to support each other.
Our organisation is open to all families – independent of origin, education and income.
Our services include:

Parent-child get-togethers
Advice on social issues
Couples and family therapy
Legal advice
Play groups
Homework support
Courses about birth
Parent training courses
Music, exercise and crafts for children
Health and exercise for parents
German course for mothers
Organising games and events in the district

For newly arrived families, we offer support and help through the programme “Miteinander: Weitergehen – Sprechen – sich Kennenlernen” (“Go further with one another – speak, get-to know others”).
