Mittelschule
Mittelschule covers year 5 to year 9 or 10. These schools prepare you above all for an apprenticeship (»» dual apprenticeship or »» college-based vocational training).
School-leaving qualifications (‘Certificates’):

after year 9: Mittelschulabschluss (basic secondary school certificate) or qualifizierender Mittelschulabschluss (qualifying secondary school certificate or ‘Quali’)
after year 10: intermediate secondary school certificate (‘Mittlere Reife’)

 More information about Mittelschule qualifications
If you want to complete a (dual) company apprenticeship, you need a Mittelschulabschluss. Without a school leaving qualification, it’s very difficult to find an apprenticeship place.
Information about registration
If children are going to attend Mittelschule from year 5, their parents don’t have to register them again. The Sprengel-Mittelschule will do this for them automatically.
