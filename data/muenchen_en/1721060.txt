Internet
In your own apartment
If you live in your own apartment, you can set up Internet (WLAN), but you must pay for it yourself. You will need to set up contracts with Internet providers which include monthly payments and usually have a minimum term of 24 months. These are often combined with a fixed line telephone connection and TV.
Hotspots free & secure - M-WLAN
The free offer M-WLAN with which you can surf free on the internet is available at many places in Munich. M-WLAN is a free service that is offered by the city together with the Stadtwerke Munich. You can find more information  here.
M-WLAN is also available encrypted. To use “M-WLAN Secure Wi-Fi” you need to register one time - it’s free. Encrypted M-WLAN enables you to connect automatically to the internet as soon as the end device, for example a Smartphone, comes near a hotspot. Using “M-WLAN Secure Wi-Fi” is easy: You need access data that you receive by registering one time, free, at a M-WLAN location. There you have to choose the free WLAN first and then select the “Secure Wi-Fi” tab in the browser. After entering your email address, the access data will be sent to this address and you can, therefore, dial into the encrypted WLAN. Of course, it’s still possible for you to use the free M-WLAN at the 21 locations in the city.
There is also free WLAN in all 21 district libraries and the Münchner Stadtbibliothek (Munich City Library).
