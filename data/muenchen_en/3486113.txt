Employment contract
Anyone who starts a job gets an employment contract. It regulates the most important conditions of an employment relationship such as working times, holiday entitlement, amount of salary and periods of notice. Both sides – workers and employers – must abide by these agreements. As the contract becomes legally valid with your signature, you should only sign it when you fully understand the content.
Types of contracts:
Permanent job contract (Unbefristeter Arbeitsvertrag)
As a general rule, there is a probationary period of three to six months. During this time, a working relationship can be cancelled by both the employee and the employer with a short notice period of two weeks. At the end of the probationary period, a permanent employment relationship begins with longer protection against dismissal. Working hours are usually up to 40 hours a week.
Fixed-term employment contract (Befristeter Arbeitsvertrag)
The employment ends at the agreed time, without the need for notice of resignation.
Mini-job (small-scale employment)
The maximum monthly income is 520 EUR and is tax-free. The employee does not have to pay contributions to the state health insurance scheme or unemployment insurance; you can also apply to be exempt from paying contributions to pension insurance. With a mini-job, you only get very minimal entitlement to an old-age pension later. You need to organise health insurance yourself; it’s a good idea to ask one of the state health insurance companies for advice.
