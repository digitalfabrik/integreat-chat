Dublin Regulation
The Dublin Regulation encompasses the area of the 28 EU member states as well as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. It determines which country is responsible for the implementation of your asylum procedure. It is usually the country in which you are registered for the first time. An electronic data collation takes place to do this.
If it is established that Germany is not responsible for the implementation of your asylum procedure, you will be sent back to the country which is responsible for you.
If you do not agree with this decision, you should get professional legal advice about whether it is worth appealing to the administrative court (Verwaltungsgericht).
