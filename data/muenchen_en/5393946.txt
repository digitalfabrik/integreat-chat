Münchner Volkstheater
The Volkstheater opened in 1983.
With Christian Stückl as artistic director, a new era began at the Volkstheater in October 2002. With a new and young ensemble, he created an independent profile and opened the house to young directors who direct alongside him. The evening programme is supplemented by concerts and readings. In this way, Christian Stückl succeeded in reaching new audiences and, at the same time, retaining the old ones.
In mid-December 2017, the decision was made to build a new facility. By 2021, the new Volkstheater will have been built on the Viehhof site for a sum of EUR 130.7 million on almost 18,000 square metres. On 15 October 2021, Christian Stückl opened the new location of the Munich Volkstheater with his production of “Edward II”.
