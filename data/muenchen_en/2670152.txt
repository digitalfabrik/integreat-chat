Fair Integration - advice about social and employment law at work
The Fair Integration advice centre gives information and advice to refugees and third country nationals on social and employment law issues. Our aim is to communicate knowledge about your rights on the German job market in order to ensure fair job market integration with fair working conditions. This is because only those who know their rights can demand them and defend themselves against exploitation and discrimination.
Focus points of advice:

Rights in a work relationship, apprenticeship relationship or internship relationship
Standards on the German job market
Questions on wages, for example if no wage or too low a wage is paid
Minimum wage
Working times
Holiday
Health insurance
Inability to work or accident at work
Termination

Who is it for: Refugees and third country nationals who are working (full-time, part-time, mini-job, temporary work...), are doing a training course or internship, or will be starting work soon and want to get information about it.
Our advice programmes are free, confidential, biased in favour of the person seeking advice and not dependent on your residence status.
The advice centre is run jointly by the projects “Fair Integration” by the Europäischer Verein für Wanderarbeiterfragen (EVW) (European Migrant Workers Union) and “Support Fair Integration” by the DGB Bildungswerk Bund (DGB Federal Education Agency).
