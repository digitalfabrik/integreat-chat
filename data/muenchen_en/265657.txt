Advice and help - asylum procedure
ArrivalAid hearing and appeal support
In the ArrivalAid hearing support refugees are prepared for and accompanied to their hearing appointment at the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (Bundesamt für Migration und Flüchtlinge – BAMF) by volunteers who are trained by ArrivalAid. We also help you to fill out the form in cases of accelerated procedure.
In the ArrivalAid appeal support the individual steps of the appeals process are explained by volunteers who have been trained by ArrivalAid. During this, the reasons for fleeing are discussed, based on the minutes of the hearing and the rejection of the BAMF.
Refugees can also be supported during the checking procedure (revocation/withdrawal of protection status) by ArrivalAid.
The programme does not constitute legal advice! We accompany and support you in the asylum procedure.
