Family asylum and international protection for family members
Family members of those with subsidiary protection also receive asylum (by application) and the status of “person entitled to protection status” (right to asylum/status of refugee or subsidiary protection).
When it comes to family asylum, a family member is:

A spouse or registered civil partner or cohabitant
Any underage, unmarried children
The parent who has right of custody of the underage, unmarried children
Other adult persons who are the registered guardians of underage, unmarried children
The underage, unmarried siblings of minors

The requirement for spouses is that a valid marriage had already taken place in the country of origin, the application for asylum was submitted before or at the same time as the spouse with subsidiary protection, at the latest immediately after their arrival in the country, and as long as the subsidiary protection is incontestable and not to be withdrawn.
Born in Germany:
If a child is born to parents following their application for asylum, the law offers them the possibility – for the protection of the child – of having their own asylum procedure if certain requirements are met. For this, the parents (at least one must still be undergoing the asylum procedure) or the Ausländerbehörde (Immigration Office) must inform the Bundesamt (Federal Office) of the birth. In the interests of the newborn child,  the asylum application is automatically considered submitted. The parents can submit asylum reasons for the child that relate specifically only to him/her. If this is not done, the same reasons as those of the parents will apply. Legal action remains open in this case should an application be rejected by the Bundesamt (Federal Office).
In addition, for the protection of the child, under-age children cannot be separated from their parents if an application has been rejected.
