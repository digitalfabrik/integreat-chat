Help with medicine costs
Do you have the München-Pass because of your low income? Then you can get medicines that are normally available in an Apotheke (chemist, pharmacy) without a prescription and, therefore, have to be paid for at a specially reduced price in some Apotheken.
If you need one of these medicines, please speak to your doctor. The doctor will issue a so-called “Grünes Rezept” or a private prescription “Privatrezept”. You present this in one of the participating Apotheken with your München-Pass, then you will receive the medicine significantly cheaper.
