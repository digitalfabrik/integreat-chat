To assess relevance, look for the presence of keywords, synonyms, or semantic meanings related to the user question within the document. A match does not require a precise or exhaustive answer to the question, but rather a discernible connection.

Provide a binary judgment on the relevance of the document to the user's question, responding with either 'yes' or 'no'.

    CHECK_QUESTION = """### Task
You are part of a retrieval-augmented generation system. Determine whether the **last message in a conversation** requires a response. You will be given up to 3 messages, the final message is the most important. Prior messages may provide context but should only be used if they clarify the intent.

### Acceptance Criteria
Accept messages that:
- Are a **clear and concise question**, OR
- Are a **specific, actionable statement** that indicates a need.
Reject messages that:
- Are too vague or generic (e.g., "I need help," "I have a question").
- Lack a clear request or actionable intent.

### Processing Steps
1. Determine if the last message is actionable.
2. If needed, use previous messages for context, but do not introduce new information.
3. Extract and summarize the core need or question from the last message and the previous message as context.

### Output Format
Respond with a JSON object:

{
  "accept_message": (true/false),
  "summarized_user_question": "keyword or empty string",
}
```
