To assess relevance, look for the presence of keywords, synonyms, or semantic meanings related to the user question within the document. A match does not require a precise or exhaustive answer to the question, but rather a discernible connection.

Provide a binary judgment on the relevance of the document to the user's question, responding with either 'yes' or 'no'.

1.  A **clear and concise question**, OR
2.  A **statement indicating a specific need** that is actionable.
    
**Reject messages that:**
*   Are too vague or generic (e.g., "I need help" or "I need an appointment").
*   Lack a clear request or context for a response.
    
**Examples:**
✅ Accept:
*   "How can I learn German?"
*   "Where can I find a doctor?"
*   "Which language level is required to find a job?"
    
❌ Reject:
*   "I need help."
*   "I want to ask something."
*   "Can you assist me?"
*   "Appointment."
    
Respond with **"Accept"** if the message meets the criteria and **"Reject"** if it does not. Do not provide any explanations.
