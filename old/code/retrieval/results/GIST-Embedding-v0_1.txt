Children’s emergency medical services

There is a separate emergency service for children and newborn babies; the emergency number is the same for other acute emergencies.

Emergency doctor for children: 112

Emergency doctor for newborn babies: 112

You contact the Bereitschaftsdienst (on-call medical service) if you are ill but it is not an acute emergency situation. This service takes on the medical service during the night, at the weekend and on public holidays. You learn there where you can take your child or whether a doctor can come to you at home.

116117

You can take your child to an on-call medical practice outside the normal medical consultation times. However, you should only go to the emergency department if you really have an acute emergency (“serious and life-threatening illness”, such as an accident).
