Appeal procedure
If you do not agree with the negative decision about your asylum application by the BAMF, you can appeal against this decision. You are the “plaintiff” and the BAMF is the “defendant”. During an appeal, the Verwaltungsgericht (Munich administrative court) checks the decision of the BAMF. If the court comes to a different decision, it compels the BAMF to offer you protection. You will then receive a residence permit. If it confirms the rejection notice, this means that the appeal has been turned down. You are then obliged to leave the country.
You can also appeal against a positive decision, for example, if you do not agree with the form of protection you have been given (exception: granting of refugee status).
In every case, we recommend that you get advice and representation from a specialist lawyer for asylum and residence law.
