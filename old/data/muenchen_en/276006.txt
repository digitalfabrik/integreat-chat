Cultural workshop for children and adolescents
Printing workshop, Rad ab bicycle workshop – with a duration of 3-4 months each we open the roof space to the cultural workshop for children and adolescents as a permanently staged project and activity room with clear topics. It is decisive for the preparation of the room that topics, questions, possible functions, activities and opportunities for action are conveyed largely independently.
The project room is based on the idea of the workshop that opens its material and tool to be accessed by the children, adolescents and young adults. Different artists and craftspeople accompany the creative process; they convey the characteristics of the work materials, basic techniques in handling the tool and encourage the visitors to experiment for themselves. The project rooms live from the mutual exchange and the possibility of drawing upon the experiences of all visitors.
Drop-in programmes, individual workshops, workshop evenings and programmes for school classes and groups are offered in the project rooms.
Who’s it for: Children between the ages of 7 – 15 yeas
Interpreters in English are available.
You can bring your children with you.
