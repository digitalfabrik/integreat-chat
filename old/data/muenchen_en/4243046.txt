Pre-school health examination
Your child will soon be starting school. All children in Munich have a health examination before starting school, between the ages of four and five.For example, they have their sight, hearing and language development checked. In the examination, the medical staff can see how and in what areas your child can best be supported from the penultimate kindergarten year, so that your child can make a good start in everyday school life.
In Bavaria, this examination is compulsory. You will receive an invitation to the examination from the health department.You can find further information about the health examination at: muenchen.de/rseu
If you do not bring your child to the health examination after receiving the invitation from the health department, your details will be given to the City of Munich Stadtjugendamt (Child Welfare Office). The Child Welfare Office will then have to contact you to find out why the examination has not taken place.Your Sozialb√ºrgerhaus (Social Centre) can offer help and support for you and your child. You can find out which Social Centre is responsible in your neighbourhood via the following link: stadt.muenchen.de/service/info/sozialbuergerhaus/1060763/
