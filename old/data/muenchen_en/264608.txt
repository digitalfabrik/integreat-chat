EU and EEA citizens
If you move within Germany, you donâ€™t need to de-register (abmelden). This takes place automatically when you register at your new place of residence.
You only need to de-register if you move abroad, become homeless or give up a second home without a replacement; you must do this within two weeks. You can de-register at the earliest one week before your departure.
You receive a copy of your de-registration as a confirmation.
