Pfadfinderinnenschaft St. Georg München und Freising (PSG)
With us, girls can discover their strengths and try out many things they always wanted to do. In weekly group sessions, divided according to age, with plenty of games and fun, we make the scout movement come alive and try out democratic structures during camping expeditions and trips. The girls learn to incorporate their own topics in a self-determined way. We are a Catholic association for women and girls but all girls from the age of 6 are welcome, independent of origin or religious belief.
Who’s it for: all women and girls between 6 and 26 years old in the arch diocese of Munich and Freising
Fees:
Membership of the PSG costs 39 EUR per year (22 EUR for sisters). As every girl should have the possibility to take part with us, you are able to pay a solidarity contribution of 10 EUR per year if you have a low income. Please register if you are in this situation via info@psg-muenchen.de. We will then find a discreet solution together.
