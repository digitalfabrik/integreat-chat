Fundbüro (Lost Property Office)
If you have lost something, the person who finds it may hand the object in to one of the offices of the Fundbüro (Lost Property Office) in Munich. It can take several days for objects to be registered in the Fundbüro (Lost Property Office).
If an object has the name and address of the owner, or the name and address can be discovered, we notify you automatically.
Otherwise you can register your lost item by telephone, in writing or with a  notice of loss.
You receive a reply if the object is actually registered with us. If you do not hear from us it means that, unfortunately, we could not find your lost item.
For items that are often lost, such as keys, spectacles, umbrellas, gloves etc., please come in person to the Fundbüro (Lost Property Office).
