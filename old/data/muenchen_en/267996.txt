Jugendinformationszentrum (JIZ) – advice on transitioning from school to career
In the Jugendinformationszentrum (JIZ, youth information centre), (also former) pupils of the Mittelschule and Realschule receive tips and support about how to start their working lives every 1st and 3rd Wednesday of the month (except in the school holidays):

Do you need to catch up on a school qualification?
You don’t know what you want to do after school?
You need tips on making applications?

Then get advice from the experts of the “Servicestelle Berufsbezogene Jugendarbeit” for the project Youth, Work, Perspectives (Kreisjugendring München-Stadt). We’re happy to take a look at any application documents you already have and improve them – we’re not allowed to re-write new application documents for you, however.
Who’s it for: adolescents and young adults from 14 to 26 years
Barrier-free access to the building and premises is available.
The service is free.
