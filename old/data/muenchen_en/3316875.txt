
Entry into Germany through a visa procedure
If you enter with a D visa for a longer stay in Germany, you must be aware of the following when you arrive:
The first thing you must do is register in your chosen town/city of residence. German law gives you a period of 14 days after your arrival to do this. In München you register in the  Bürgerbüros (Residents’ Office). In order to register or re-register, you can go personally to the Bürgerbüro (Residents’ Office) or have a person authorised by you bring the registration form, filled in and signed. In both cases you need an appointment which you can arrange  online. After you have successfully registered you will receive a registration certificate (Meldebescheinigung).
In the second step you apply for a residence permit:

The national visa (category D) was issued to you to enter Germany. It is not issued for the planned duration of your stay however. That’s why you need a residence permit.
You have to apply for the residence permit at the »» Ausländerbehörde (Immigration Office).
It’s important that you apply for the residence permit while your visa is still valid.
The residence permit is temporary but can be extended.
Independently of the reason for your entry to Germany, the residence permit also regulates:


If you are allowed to work or not,
What work you are allowed to do and
If time limits apply for employment in Germany.

Extending a residence permit:
Please note that you should apply to extend your residence permit already six to eight weeks before it expires.Independently of the purpose of your stay, there may be other things to take into account. You will also receive this information at the »» Ausländerbehörde (Immigration Office).
