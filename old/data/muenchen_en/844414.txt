Registering and re-registering your place of residence
If you move to Munich, you must register as soon as possible. If you move apartment within the city area you need to re-register your new place within two weeks. It is an offence not to do this and you could be fined.
In order to register or re-register, you can go personally to the  Bürgerbüro or have a person authorised by you bring the registration form, filled in and signed. If you come to the Bürgerbüro (citizens’ office), you need an appointment. You can arrange it  online here.
