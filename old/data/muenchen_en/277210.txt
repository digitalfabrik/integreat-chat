“Offene Hilfe” advice centre
“Offene Hilfe” is an advice centre for women in difficult living circumstances, e.g. who are homeless or who fear losing their apartment.
We offer appointments for advice at short notice (by phone/in person):
- about “housing” and/or “loss of housing”
- in the event of financial problems (securing legal claims to financial benefits, support in the event of problems with authorities)
- in case of personal crises (family difficulties, violence protection law)
- for referral to facilities for homeless people and/or outpatient services (debt and migration counselling, women’s shelters, etc.)
We also offer various group programmes, as well as temporary use of an escrow account for women who do not have their own account.
Please make an appointment.
Who’s it for: women with and without children
The advice service is free.
You can bring your children with you.
All premises have barrier-free access as well as a disabled toilet.
