Trauma help
Flight and migration owing to war and displacement are ever-present and place people in unbearable situations. Many suffer consequences from these situations for the rest of their lives. Many of those traumatised, however, receive therapeutic help only at a late stage. This is where our trauma support comes in. As a support measure, it can help people learn to live with the consequences of trauma, even if it is not itself a therapy.
Our trauma help is based on easily understood bodily exercises and simple cognitive methods to strengthen resources.
