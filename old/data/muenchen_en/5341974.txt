Equal rights for women and men
Women and men have the same rights in Germany. This is set down in article 3 of the German Grundgesetz (basic law). Women can learn German, go to a doctor, learn an occupation and find work. They don’t need the permission of their husband or other family members. Women can marry who they want and also get divorced or separate from their husbands if the relationship doesn’t work out or if their partner is violent. They can live in a relationship with a man or a women or they can live alone.
If couples separate, the children can live with the mother, the father or sometimes part-time with both parents. If the parents cannot agree where the children should live, the courts decide what is best for the children.
Despite having the same rights, it can happen that women are disadvantaged in their job, everyday life or in the family. There are various advice centres for women. There you can find out about your rights and you get help so that you can lead an independent and equal life.
