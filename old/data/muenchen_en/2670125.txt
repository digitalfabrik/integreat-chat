Mädchentreff Blumenau
The Mädchentreff Blumenau is a feminist-oriented shelter and free space where girls* and young women* can meet and try things out. Meeting friends, dancing, doing sport, making music, baking, cooking and creative activities are included in our programme as well as joint parties, projects, film afternoons and trips.
Alongside games and having fun, it’s also about  discussing things, getting involved politically, implementing your own wishes and incorporating your strengths. It is important to speak about problems and find solutions together, plan your own future and exchange information on important issues for girls* and young women* from Blumenau.
The Mädchentreff Blumenau campaigns for equal rights for all genders, for solidarity and diversity and fights against sexism, racism and all other forms of discrimination.
Who is it for: Girls* and young women* between 9 and 18 years
Barrier-free access to the building and premises is available in part.
There is no charge for taking part in the drop-in get-togethers. A small contribution is collected for trips and journeys.
