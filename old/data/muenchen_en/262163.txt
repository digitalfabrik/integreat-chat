In Germany there are two different types of mobile phone contract: Prepaid contract and fixed-term contract. The prepaid contract does not have a fixed duration. With a fixed term contract there is a minimum contract duration; this contract will be renewed automatically if you do not cancel it. If you do not want this contract to be renewed automatically, you have to make this known in writing. Be aware of the cancellation period. It is written in the contract.
Before you sign a contract, find out from your friends, ask around and think what details are especially important for you.
Ten important questions concerning taking out a contract:

What is the monthly payment? Does the fee increase after a certain period?
Is there a minimum monthly charge (minimum cost per month)?
How long is the contract period (e.g. 12 or 24 months)?
When do I have to cancel the contract if I do not want it to be renewed?
How much are the fees for setting up, changing or deactivating?
What is the billing cycle (60/1, 10/10)?
How much does a minute cost (different/own network)?
What are the costs for buying a mobile phone with and without a contract?
How much does Internet access cost?
How much does it cost to call abroad?

Think about which flat rate is the best for you and find out what the flat rate doesnâ€™t cover and what the extra costs will be.
