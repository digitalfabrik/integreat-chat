Earning your driving licence
You are not allowed to drive a car without a driving licence. To earn your driving licence, you must attend a certain number of practical and theoretical lessons and then pass both a practical and a theoretical test.
To apply for your driving licence at the Führerscheinstelle (Driving Licence Authority) and take the test, you need a valid identification document ([foreign] identity card, passport or residence permit), as well as a place of residence in Munich. You must also be at least 17 (accompanied driving) or 18 years old.
The theoretical test can also be taken in English; for the practical test, you must at least be able to follow the instructions given by the driving instructor and examiner in German.
You can even take driving lessons before submitting your application: the application is required only for taking the tests, as the Driving Licence Authority sends the corresponding examination order to Germany’s official certification body – the “TÜV”.
If you have questions about training and taking a test, find out more from a driving school.
Having a foreign driving licence converted
If you have a foreign driving licence, you can drive with it in for up to six months after you first register in Germany. If your driving licence is not in Latin letters, you need an international driving licence right from the start. After six months, you need to have certain types of driving licences converted. This is not necessary if you posses a permanent driving licence from an EU or EEA country (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway) without classes C, C1, C1E, CE, D, D1, D1E and DE.Driving without a valid driving licence is a criminal offence.

Note on the environmental zone
In München, the whole area within the Mittlerer Ring is designated an environmental zone. This means that you are only allowed to drive a car in it with a valid green sticker. It is possible to get a special exemption permit in some cases.

On parking places with a wheelchair symbol, parking is only allowed with a special pass.
For some parking places with temporary time limit without a parking ticket, you need a parking disc with which you indicate your arrival time and leave it visibly in the vehicle.
In the “Anwohnerparken” zones, you can only park at the times indicated with a special parking pass for residents.
For many parking places, you have to pay a parking ticket at a machine. With the  app HandyParken this is also possible without cash.
