Leaving the country with a Fiktionsbescheinigung (probationary residence permit)
With a Fiktionsbescheinigung (probationary residence permit) you have a temporary right of residence. There are different types of Fiktionsbescheinigung (probationary residence permit).
Please note:
It is only possible to return to the Federal Republic of Germany with a Fiktionsbescheinigung (probationary residence permit) according to Section 81 par. 4 German Residence Act (AufenthG).. It confirms a probationary continuing residence permit and is also known as a “Fortgeltungsfiktion”. If you make an application to extend your residence permit, your current Fiktionsbescheinigung (probationary residence permit) is regarded as continuing. Your continuing stay is legal with the same restrictions as the expired residence permit.
