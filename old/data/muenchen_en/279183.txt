Haus der Eigenarbeit (HEi)
The HEi offers space for all those who enjoy DIY (Do-It-Yourself): crafts, culture and social!
The open workshops (such as wood, textile, metal workshops) can be used by anyone to realise their own projects. It doesn’t matter if you want to try something out for the first time or if you already know a lot. You can work by yourself, get specialist advice or take part in a course in various professionally equipped workshops. There are also many options for school pupils at the HEi. We give proper consideration to cultural and social perspectives and organise exhibitions, readings and advice sessions on many topics and in our workshop café.
