Unterhaltsvorschuss offices of the Stadtjugendamt
If the parents of a child do not live together, the parent with whom the child doesn’t permanently live must pay the other parent a sum of money regularly that helps to pay for the care, parenting and supervision of the child. This money is known as maintenance (Unterhalt).
The amount of the correspondingly applicable minimum maintenance payment (minus Kindergeld for the first child) is calculated according to the  Düsseldorfer Table.
Advance payment for maintenance (Unterhaltsvorschuss) helps to secure the living costs of children of single mothers and parents who do not regularly receive (enough) maintenance or orphan payments.
Children up to and including the age of 18 are entitled to this if they or the parent looking after them have German nationality or an entitlement to freedom of movement (EU /EEA nationality), a Niederlassungserlaubnis (settlement permit), or Aufenthaltserlaubnis (residence permit with entitlement to work; permanent stay).
