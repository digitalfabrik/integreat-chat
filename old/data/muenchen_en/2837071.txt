
Catching up on your school qualifications
Mittelschulabschluss (basic secondary school certificate)
People between the ages of 16 and 21 (in exceptional cases, up to the age of 25) who do not have a recognised school-leaving qualification in Germany and want to intensively improve their language skills may be able to catch up on their school qualification: Mittelschulabschluss (basic secondary school certificate) or qualifizierender Mittelschulabschluss (qualifying secondary school certificate or “Quali“) in a municipal vocational integration class (Berufsintegrationsklasse / BIK).
People from the age of 25 with a low income are also able to catch up on the Mittelschulabschluss (basic secondary school certificate) free. In a course financed by the city of München, you will be prepared for the  qualification in an intensive one year course.
A school qualification improves your chances of finding work or an apprenticeship.
