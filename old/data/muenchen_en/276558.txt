Webgrrls Bayern e. V.
We Webgrrls are a business network for women. Our motto is: Knowledge. Experience. Share. We support each other appreciatively, respectfully and mindfully in our professional and personal development. To the outside world, it’s our aim to raise the visibility of women in the world of work. We inform, inspire and encourage each other at over 30 get-togethers per year in Bavaria. We offer the younger Webgrrlies up to around “32” their own get-togethers, workshops and a mentoring programme.
