HEROES – Against oppression in the name of honour
HEROES is a project of the Arbeiterwohlfahrt (AWO) München, in which young men critically question oppression in the name of honour and speak up for equality. During the weekly training that takes place on Thursdays from 17:30 to 19:30, they talk and eat together but also discuss issues such as equality, honour and human rights.
If they regularly take part in the training sessions, they are given the title of HERO during a ceremony, usually after about nine months. As a certified HERO they are allowed to lead workshops in schools and youth institutions together with the group leaders. The aim of these workshops is to teach the topics of the HEROES training programmes to other adolescents using role play and discussions, i.e. passing on the ideas that you learned yourself to others.
