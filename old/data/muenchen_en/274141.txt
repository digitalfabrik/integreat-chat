Registering for a Kita
What is the kita finder+?
The kita finder+ is the online registration portal for childcare institutions in the federal capital city of Munich. It includes an overview of all childcare institutions in Munich.
You have to sign up initially and then you can register your child for one or several institutions (at the earliest twelve months before you would like the care to begin). It’s a good idea to register for several institutions because then the chances of you finding a place at the time you want and for the conditions you want will increase. You can also accept places offered to you via the kita finder+.
How do you register in the kita finder+?

You need to decide: From when and for how many hours daily do your want your child to be looked after?
Get information about child daycare centres near your apartment, try to attend the “Tag der offenen Tur” (open day, these usually take place in February; it’s best to ask the daycare centre directly)
