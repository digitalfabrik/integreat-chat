Freedom of opinion
Everyone is entitled to form their own opinion and express it freely. People are also allowed to express those opinions in public. All media are also free, and everyone can obtain information from them. Anyone who expresses their opinion openly must be aware of respecting the personal honour and dignity of other people.
This means, for example:

You are allowed to criticise the government.
You are allowed to criticise religion.
Artistic works are allowed to be provocative. Nobody is allowed to tell writers, musicians or visual artists what their work should be about.
The government and religions can be the subjects of satire and critical art.
If someone feels they have been slandered, insulted or defamed, or that their personal reputation or worth has been maligned, they can contact the police or a court.

The following behaviour is not allowed in Germany:

The use of unconstitutional symbols and calls to overthrow democracy.
Insulting statements of opinion that denigrate other people.
Defamation of character or libel regarding other people.
Incite hatred or violence.
