WILMA – leisure group for lesbian and bisexual women
WILMA is a leisure group for young lesbian, bisexual women and those who are unsure, who would like to do things together and want to get to know new people. If you feel uncertain before taking part for the first time or have any questions about the group, you are welcome to contact our social education workers at any time. Our get-togethers represent a safe space: To preserve your anonymity, no photos or video recordings are made. The programme is open to trans women and non-binary persons.
