Introduction to university study at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU)
It’s not always possible to realise your wish to study immediately, for example, if you do not have sufficient knowledge of German. That’s why the LMU has developed a programme called Introduction to university study at the LMU for refugees as well as asylum-seekers who already have experience of studying. Content:

Orientation discussions
German course for people interested in studying
Workshops on intercultural communication
Higher education access verification
