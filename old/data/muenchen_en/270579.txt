Works councils and unions
In Germany, employees have the right to be involved in decisions at work, in the company and in the economy as a whole and stand up for their interests.
Works council
Upwards of a certain size of company, the law says that the employees of a company have to be represented in the form of a works council (for public services: Personalrat or staff council). A works council represents the interests of the employees in a company and has participation rights. The council is chosen by the employees – according to the legal requirements.
Unions
In unions, workers get together to be able to represent and implement their economic and social interests against those of the employer.
In Germany there are eight different unions that cover all job categories. They advise their members on issues regarding employee and social law, negotiate wage tariffs and support the worker’s councils.
