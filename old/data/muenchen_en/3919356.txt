Hygiene
Good hygiene helps you to stay healthy. Regularly washing your hands is just as important as clean toilet hygiene.

Protection provided by vaccination
Every day we come into contact with viruses, bacteria or fungi. This contact can result in illness, but it does not have to. Often the body protects itself against viruses, bacteria or fungus.
Infectious diseases can be passed on from person to person or, in some situations, from food or objects. Some diseases can be passed from animals to humans.
You can get vaccinated to protect yourself against some infectious diseases such as the flu, mumps, chicken pox, measles or rubella (German measles). It is best to consult your doctor about which vaccinations are appropriate for you. Some vaccinations must be repeated after a certain period of time so that vaccination protection is not lost.
