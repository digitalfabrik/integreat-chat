Religious freedom
Religion and beliefs are private matters in Germany. The state does not prescribe to anyone whether they should have religious beliefs or which god they should believe in. The state and religion are separate.
This means, for example:

All people have the freedom to choose and practice their religion and beliefs themselves.
All people have the freedom to not follow a religion and to state that fact openly. If someone does not believe in God, they are free to state this publicly.
Members of different religions and faiths are allowed to marry each other and have children.
Marriage is only considered legally valid if it is recognised by the Standesamt (registry office). Marriages that have only been performed in a religious context are not considered legally binding in Germany.

The following behaviour is not allowed in Germany:

Putting religious rules or traditions above the laws of the German state. One example would be a man married to multiple women at the same time, or slaughtering an animal without a special permit.
Boys can only be circumcised if it does not negatively affect their well-being.

Many people in Germany now work to ensure that there is dialogue between religions. The aim is the peaceful co-existence of people who are religious, those who are devout and those who do not belong to any religion. The state is committed to ideological neutrality. Provided that practising a religion does not endanger democracy or the separation of state and religion, it will be protected.
