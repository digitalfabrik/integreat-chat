What is a daycare centre (Kita)?
Kita is a shortened version of the word Kindertageseinrichtung. There are different forms of care:

Day nursery (Kinderkrippe): From the 9th week of life up to the age of 3
Kindergarten: 3 years to starting school (6 or 7 years)
Haus für Kinder: 9th week of life up to the age of 12 (nursery, kindergarten and after-school care under one roof)
Parent-child initiative: Parents get together and organise a childcare organisation together. There are offers for all age groups.
After-school care centre (Hort): School children from year 1 to year 4, supervision in school or near the school
Daycare facility (Tagesheim): School children from year 1 to year 4, supervision in the school, close cooperation with the school

What can my child experience in a Kita?

 The Kita is usually open all day from Monday to Friday.
There is a fixed daily routine (eating times, play times, rest times).
 Your child can make new friends.
 Your child can play and learn how to use many different toys and materials.
 Your child can play in the garden.
The nursery school teachers will encourage your child’s development.

Childcare in a family
This form of care is particularly suitable for children under the age of three. Trained carers (known as Tagesmütter or Tagesväter [child-minders]) take care of up to five children at their home in a family-like atmosphere. If the carer falls ill, replacement care is organised. The costs of a municipally organised Kita place are not higher than those for a day nursery.
