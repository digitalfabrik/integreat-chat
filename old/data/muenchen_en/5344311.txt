
Alcoholics Anonymous
Alcoholics Anonymous is a worldwide fellowship for people who have a problem with alcohol.
The members have the same problem. That is why they understand each other and can support each other well. The members help each other to stay sober. Together, the way out of addiction is easier.
The only requirement for membership is the desire to stop drinking.
There are many different groups in Munich. At the weekly meetings we talk about our own experiences with drinking. And about the experiences of quitting and living without alcohol. The talks give strength and courage.
You can find the locations and times of the groups here: .
The offer is free of charge.
