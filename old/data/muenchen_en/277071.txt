Mother-child facilities
The Sozialdienst katholischer Frauen in München e. V.  operates several mother-child facilities. Here, adult pregnant women or single mothers receive an apartment or a room for themselves and their children. The facilities offer social-pedagogic counselling and support in many areas of life: in all issues that affect your children; in relationship problems; in training and jobs. We work on a plan for your future together with you.
Who’s it for: Pregnant women or mothers whose youngest child  is not older than 6 years
 Interpreters are available on request.
The advice  is free, rent and supplementary charges must be paid with your own income or with the help of social benefits.
