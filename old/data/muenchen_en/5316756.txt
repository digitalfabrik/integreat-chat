
Malteser Hilfsdienst
We help people without health insurance whose lives are very much rooted in München. In our advice centre, these patients find a doctor who can carry out the initial examination and emergency care in the event of sudden illness, injury or pregnancy.The medical examination is always preceded by a detailed social counselling discussion.We support every patient who wants to take out health insurance for the first time or return. The social advisers communicate with the German health insurance companies, the Sozialbürgerhäuser (social services offices) and authorities and if necessary accompany patients during the necessary visits to the authorities.
