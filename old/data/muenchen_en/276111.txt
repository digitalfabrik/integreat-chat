Opstapje-Programme – playing and learning
Opstapje (Dutch for “springboard") is a playing and learning programme. We will support you in encouraging the age appropriate development of your child. Once a week our adviser visits you at home and brings play material for your child: Books, balls, puzzles, crayons and much more. Every two weeks there is a group get-together in which we tell you about different issues in parenting and development. You can also get to know other mothers and fathers there.
Who’s it for: all families with children between the ages of 1 and 3 who would like support
Childcare is available during the group get-together.
The programme costs 10 EUR per month.
