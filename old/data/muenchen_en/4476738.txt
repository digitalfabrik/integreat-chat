Register to get married
In Germany a marriage is only legally valid if it is authorised by the Standesamt (registry office).
You can only register for a marriage six months before the planned date at the earliest. The registration is valid for six months. If you have gathered all necessary documents together, you should both go together to the Standesamt that is responsible for your residential area.
