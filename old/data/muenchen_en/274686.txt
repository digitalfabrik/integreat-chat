Mini-München Play City
Mini-München – City of the Children
Mini-München Play City is Munich’s largest holiday programme. Simple rules and a staged urban space/play area start off differentiated play events that are created by children and adolescents between the ages of 7 and 15 over a period of three weeks. The project is accompanied by adults who possess a wide range of expertise: they make suggestions and play along too. The children work, study, earn money, consume, get involved in politics, or stroll around Mini-München as attentive observers. The children decide themselves how long they join in and in what way. You do not need to register to take part.
