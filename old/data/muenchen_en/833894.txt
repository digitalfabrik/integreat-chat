Munich Kyiv Queer
Fight for Global Rights – Solidarity knows no borders.
Lesbian, gay, bi, trans* and lnter* (LGBTl) people suffer disenfranchisement, persecution and assault in many places around the world. We stand in solidarity with them.
The contact group Munich Kyiv Queer, founded in 2012 after the CSD in Munich, specifically campaigns for the human rights of homo-, bi-, trans* and inter* people in Ukraine. The twinning between Kyiv and Munich is the basis for this. Since then, a lively cooperation has developed between the lesbian, gay and trans* groups of both cities, which are bound together in friendship. The joint projects have long since extended beyond Kyiv to the whole of Ukraine.
Currently, we mainly offer help for LGBTIQ* refugees from Ukraine who come to Bavaria/Munich, but we also support queer people in Ukraine.
What we offer: counselling, accommodation, group meetings with refugees and helpers, paperwork, German courses
Who’s it for: LGBTIQ*
The service  is free. You can bring your children with you.
All premises have barrier-free access as well as a disabled toilet.
