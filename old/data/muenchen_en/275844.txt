Treff 21 youth centre
Treff 21 is a youth leisure club in the Munich district of Blumenau for girls* and young women* as well as boys* and young men*.
The programmes are diverse, ranging from creative activities, listening to music and DIY, meeting friends, dancing, cooking and baking, playing football, basketball, table tennis, billiards or table football, as well as support with making applications, giving presentations and other school tasks. We also go on trips such as to the leisure park or swimming pools.
At Treff 21 we place great value on gender-conscious work. Girls* and boys* are supported appropriately with their corresponding special needs. For example, every week there is a girls* day and a boys* day for gender-specific work. Treff 21 is a violence-free environment for everyone in which pedagogical specialist staff work actively against racism to create a supportive community. People who are interested can simply come along without registering to the Treff 21 meeting point.
Who’s it for: Girls* and boys* who are 10 to 18 years old are welcome in the Treff. There are also special programmes for children from 6 years of age and young men* and women* from 18 years.
The service is non-binding or obligatory. The children and adolescents are not charged for taking part in the drop-in get-togethers. A small contribution is collected for trips and journeys.
The premises are mostly barrier-free. A disabled toilet is available.
