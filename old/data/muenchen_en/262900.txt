Social justice
The state must respect and protect human dignity. It should, therefore, ensure that social justice applies to the greatest extent possible. It takes legal, financial and material actions to do so. Everyone in Germany who is earning money pays part of their earnings to the state (tax). The higher your income, the more you have to pay. The more you earn, the more taxes you pay. The state is expected to spend this money for the benefit of everyone living in Germany.
This means, for example:

Every person registered as living in Germany has the right to basic medical care. This includes medical treatment in the case of illness or accident.
All people who are employed and required to contribute to social security pay contributions for their health insurance, social security and pension.
Every adult must make an effort to pay for their own living expenses. If a person is not able to do this, they can request support from the state.
The state ensures that taxes are used to reduce social inequality and help people in crisis (refugees, for example).
The state provides financial support to parents, for example through child benefits.

The following behaviour is not allowed in Germany:

Tax fraud, for example paying fewer taxes than required.
Receiving state benefits without being entitled to them.
