Freedom from violence / physical integrity
Everyone has the right to live their lives free from violence. This means that everyone has the right to life and physical integrity. This applies to both physical and mental health. It also applies to people’s private lives.
This means, for example:

Conflicts should be resolved without violence.
If someone needs help because of danger or conflict, they can call the police.
The instructions of the police must be followed.
Taking the law into your own hands (vigilante justice) is not allowed. A state court will decide in the case of a person’s own rights being violated.
The state must act in a non-violent manner. It is only permitted to use violence in exceptional cases when all other methods have failed. There is no death penalty or corporal punishment. Torture is forbidden.

The following behaviour is not allowed in Germany:

Abusing, injuring or killing another person. This also applies among families, in schools and on the streets.
Taking part in a fight in which people are killed or seriously injured.
Vendettas (blood revenge) or murder in the name of honour.
Any kind of violence to women and children at any time, anywhere.
