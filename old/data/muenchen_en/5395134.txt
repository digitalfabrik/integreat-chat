
Specialist counselling for religious and ideological diversity
We are an open contact point for questions about religion and worldview. You can also come to us with questions about the city of Munich and questions about cooperation with the city administration.
Counselling is solution-oriented, netral and confidential. This means that no one finds out when you talk to us.
Our goal is to reduce disadvantage and enable religious-ideological diversity and equality.
You will receive from us, for example, orientation, information, support, accompaniment, contact with the city administration. If you wish, counselling can also take place at your place.
The offer is free of charge.
Interpreters are also available by arrangement.
Children can be brought along.
There is barrier-free access to the building and premises. There is a WC suitable for the disabled.
