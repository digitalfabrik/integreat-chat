Obtain a Sterbeurkunde (death certificate)
A Sterbeurkunde (death certificate) officially confirms a person’s death. The certificate must be presented to banks and insurance companies, for example.
The Standesamt responsible for your residential area issues a death certificate after a death has occurred. The undertakers (funeral directors) whom you have commissioned to organise the burial also arrange the notification of the death. After the registration has been completed, you receive the death certificates you have ordered from the undertaker’s.
