Arabic Saturday School
Our Saturday School is designed for children between the ages of 6 and 12 whose mother tongue is Arabic, but who do not yet read and write well. The children are taught by Arabic teachers. In three classes, divided according to age and ability, the children learn how to read and write in an enjoyable way using fairytales and songs, local and Arabic history. The aim is to teach the children to master their mother tongue well because then they will learn German more easily. The tuition takes place weekly (apart from in the school holidays).
Registration takes place by email:  pateninitiative@gmail.com (please give telephone number, address, name and age of the child). Arabic-speaking teachers will then get in touch with you.
Parallel to the lessons for the children, the parents can take part in a German conversation course with voluntary German teachers.
The tuition is free. Books and writing material are provided. We request 10 EUR per month (15 EUR for 2 children, 20 EUR for 3 or more children) for the children’s drinks/snacks in the breaks.
