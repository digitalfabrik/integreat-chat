German classes for children who have immigrated to Germany
The German class is a class for children and adolescents who are new to Germany and do not speak enough German to follow the lessons in a regular class. Foreign pupils of different nationalities attend the class for one year. The German classes are intended to prepare you to attend a regular school class. Tuition in other subjects can only take place to a limited extent, as the pupils can only speak a little German. Parents of school-aged children should contact the »» Sprengelschule (district school) (Grundschule, Mittelschule). The Sprengelschule will organise registration of your child.
