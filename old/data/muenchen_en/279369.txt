Bi.Yourself – leisure group for young bisexual people
Bi.Yourself is a leisure group for all bisexual people and people who are unsure between the ages of 14 and 27 years, who would like to do things together and want to get to know new people. If you feel uncertain before taking part for the first time or have any questions about the group, you are welcome to contact our social education workers at any time. As our meetings are intended to create a safe space and to preserve your anonymity, no photos or video recordings are made. The programme is open for trans and non-binary persons.
