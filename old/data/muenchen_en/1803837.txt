Private tutoring - General information
Private tutoring or learning support is additional support for a school subject outside the classroom. You usually must pay for this yourself.
For example, private tutoring and learning support are useful if a pupil could be held back (not pass to the next school year at the end of the current school year) or their school-leaving certificate is at risk or if a pupil does not know a lot of the contents taught in the classroom. Talk to the teachers at the school and ask whether private tutoring or learning support is a good idea. Perhaps the school itself can provide this.
It is sometimes possible to get learning support paid for through the Bildungs- und Teilhabepaket / BuT (education and participation programme). You can apply for the support in your »» Sozialbürgerhaus .
