
Blaues Kreuz München e. V. - Help for addicts and their relatives
We support people at risk of addiction and addicts on the path of "help for self-help". We also support relatives.
In our self-help groups, members help each other. Here you find people who have the same problem. They know the daily withdrawal symptoms, the hardships and the despair in which those affected find themselves. Together they have the chance to find a way out of addiction.
Our groups are bound by confidentiality. This means that no one is allowed to tell anyone what was said in the group. The groups are open to all people, regardless of faith or origin. We also offer information events, acute help for those affected, talks for those affected and for relatives.
