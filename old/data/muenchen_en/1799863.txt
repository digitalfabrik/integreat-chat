Renting an apartment
Rental contract
The amount of rent you pay is agreed in the rental contract. When tenants sign this contract, they agree to pay that amount of rent. The rent consists of ‘Kaltmiete’ (basic amount), ‘Nebenkosten’ (ancillary costs – waste collection, operating costs) and ‘Heizkosten’ (heating costs).
The contract must include the following points:

Name and address of the landlord
Address of the property
Living space in m²
Number of rooms
Agreed amount of “cold” rent
Agreed amount of operational costs
Agreed amount of heating costs
Total rent
The amount of the deposit

The contract stipulates when the rent will be paid. If the rent is paid late several times, this can lead to the rental contract being cancelled.
If you are unemployed and receiving financial support from the Jobcenter, please also note the »» “Financial support from the Jobcenter" under “Financial support for housing".
Security deposit
The security deposit is a payment you make to the landlord. The amount of the deposit is a maximum of 3 months' rent (basic rent without utility and heating costs). When you move out of the property, you get the money back.
Important: You must not leave any damage if you move out of the property. If there is any damage, you will not get the full deposit back.
