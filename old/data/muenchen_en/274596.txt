KinderschutzZentrum München
The KinderschutzZentrum München is an advice centre for families from the city of Munich, the district of Munich and Upper Bavaria. They receive advice in difficult life situations, if the wellbeing of children is affected by neglect, physical, mental or sexual violence in the family or the social environment or suspected of being affected. We offer children and parents counselling and therapeutic help, also in acute crises. We strengthen parents in their relationship with their children and support them in bringing up their children in a violence-free and loving environment. We help children and adolescents who have suffered sometimes traumatic experiences of violence such as neglect, abuse, serious conflicts between parents, psychological illness of the parents or sexual abuse, to deal with this as well as they can.
