Special examinations for children
Children and adolescents are offered ten medical check-ups (known as Früherkennungsuntersuchungen /U1 to U9 and J1) over the course of their childhood and adolescence. These examinations are meant to check whether the child is healthy and developing well. Parents are given advice about topics such as vaccinations, nutrition or linguistic and motoric development.
The U1 (examination after birth) and U2 (between the 3rd and 10th day of life) examinations usually take place in the maternity hospital. For the other examinations, you must make an appointment with your children's doctor (paediatrician).
The medical check-ups U1 to U9, which take place from the first days of life to the child’s 6th birthday, are compulsory in Bavaria. When you apply for certain benefits, and when register for a place at a nursery, kindergarten or school, they may ask for proof that your child has attended all the early detection check-ups.
