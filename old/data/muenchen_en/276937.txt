Projekt-Laden International Haidhausen
Welcome to the Projekt-Laden International Haidhausen!
Our door to the Projekt-Laden in Metzstr. 37 is open to families, women and children of all nationalities – and everyone who is interested in intercultural exchange, or who would like to visit a group or event.
Our group programme:
The international women’s group is a drop-in group: Here you can make contacts, discuss things and practice speaking German. There are lectures on various topics and parties & trips are organised.
Everyone interested is invited to the international sewing group – to sew or to learn sewing.
In the spring and summer, the Projekt-Laden offers cycling courses for women.
The international children’s group is open to primary school children and offers help with homework (please register in advance).
The international girls group and the international boys group are drop-in groups for children aged 7 to 12.
