Translation of documents
In Germany, official documents such as certificates and references, marriage or birth certificates, may only be translated by certified translators. These translations can be very expensive. Please check beforehand whether you really need a certified translation and compare the translation prices.
In some situations, costs for translations can be paid by the authorities. Before you commission the translation, ask:

at the office that needs the translations
at the authorities from whom you receive social benefits
