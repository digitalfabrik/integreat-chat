Apply for a certificate of good conduct
A certificate of good conduct serves as evidence that you do not have a criminal record. The information from this central register is commonly known as a “polizeiliches Führungszeugnis”. Employers can require you to present the certificate of good conduct; you also need it if you work in the security industry, for example, with children or for a public institution.
There are various certificates of good conduct. Find out which one you need from the institution or employer you need it for.
You receive this service directly and without needing to make an appointment from the  Bürgerbüro.
