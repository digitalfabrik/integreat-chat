Azuro – advice centre for training and future
We provide advice to adolescents and young adults about problems and issues during their vocational training. The aim is to avoid them unnecessarily breaking off their apprenticeship. Azuro helps apprentices to be self-reliant and supports them in resolving difficult situations during their training. The programme individually adapts to the needs of those seeking advice. It is confidential, practical and free. If you agree, we will involve other parties and work together to find a solution.
