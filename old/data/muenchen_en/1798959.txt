Delivery and aftercare
Your gynaecologist will refer you to a maternity hospital. You will receive a birth confirmation letter from the hospital. Ask at the clinic for a midwife for follow-up post-natal care. If the hospital is not able to refer you to a midwife, contact the Early Years Help of the Koordinierenden Kinderschutzstellen (KoKi), which you will find in all München »» Sozialbürgerhäuser.
