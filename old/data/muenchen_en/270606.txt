Irregular and illegal employment
A job that is paid but not registered with the Finanzamt (tax office) and health insurance company, and for which thus no taxes and social security payments are paid, is illegal and is referred to in Germany as "Schwarzarbeit” or “moonlighting” in English. It can be punished with fines and prison!
If someone gets social benefits or unemployment benefits, but still works and keeps their job secret from the Sozialamt (Social Welfare Office), the Arbeitsagentur (Employment Agency) or the Jobcenter, this is also illegal employment: A person is thus wrongly receiving state benefits, even though they are in paid employment. This is forbidden and against the law. In German it is known as “Schwarzarbeit”. You should always inform the office where you get benefits if you want to start a job; you are allowed to earn money while still receiving social benefits (the benefits are then recalculated) but you must inform the case officers of every kind of earnings and income immediately.
Taking up work even though you are forbidden to work is also regarded as illegal employment.
Depending on your country of origin and reason for staying, illegal employment can lead to you being permanently forbidden to work!
