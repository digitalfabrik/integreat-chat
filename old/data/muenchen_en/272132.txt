Psychosocial AIDS advice centres
Caritas München
HIV can suddenly change the life of people affected. But these days, HIV can be treated very effectively. With the correct medication, it’s possible to lead a near-normal life and grow old with the infection. If you take the medication regularly, you cannot infect other people any more.
The psychosocial AIDS advice centre advises and supports people with HIV/Aids. You can ring us or come to us at our advice centre. Counselling is free and totally confidential.
