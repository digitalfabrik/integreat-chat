Rights of people with disabilities
The UN convention on the rights of people with disabilities describes human rights from the perspective of the disabled. It was passed by the UN General Assembly in December 2006. In Germany, it was put into effect in March 2009 and has since been valid in law.
The federal capital city of Munich has accepted the order that also applies to municipalities according to the UN convention on the rights of people with disabilities. The central goal is to design the city community so that it is inclusive. Inclusion means the full and equal participation of people with disabilities in the same way as non-disabled and from the start: self-determination should be enabled and promoted in all phases and aspects of life in Munich. Structural, social, individual and mental barriers and every form of discrimination should be dismantled and prevented.

This is written in Article 3, Par. 3 of the German Grundgesetz (basic law): “Nobody should be discriminated against because of a disability.”
The city administration has developed strategies for this in 2 action plans. They optimise the structural conditions for people with disabilities and aim for a city-wide understanding of inclusion.
