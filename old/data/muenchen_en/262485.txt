Integration through knowledge
The project “Integration through knowledge – promoting equal opportunity” supports people who do not come from European countries.
The aim of the project is to support you in your new homeland in all life situations. There is a lot to learn and we would like to support you in this in very small groups. Our programme is made up of three workshop series with lessons on these topics:
1. Learning in the right way
- Thinking about your own learning biography
- Learning techniques
- Concentration exercises
- Time management
- Where to learn
- Getting organised
2. Smoothing the paths for more knowledge
- Language
- Employment relationships
- Housing
- Finances
- Participation
- School
- Insurance
- Health
- Mobility
 - Non-verbal communication
3. First steps/first information about getting a job in Germany
- Training
- Employee
- Rights and obligations
 - Job market
 - Employer
- Conflicts at work
The workshops will be adapted towards your needs. Please get in touch with us if you are interested in one or more of these workshops. We look forward to seeing you!
